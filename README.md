Both these files were created and run in Google Colab.

The 'DBSCAN_bgSub.ipynb' file includes our extended implementation of the DBSCAN background modelling algorithm. The background image included in the code, is an example image created from the 'Highway' video, originating from the 'Baseline' data set from CDNET2014.
Credit to https://github.com/vimlord/Clustering-Background-Subtraction for the backbone.

The 'FS_UNET++.ipynb' file includes our implementation of the UNET++ network, as well as a training/prediction session. This example is of the network training and predicting on the 'Baseline' data set from CDNET2014.
